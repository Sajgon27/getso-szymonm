I would put both files in the main folder of my theme.
Would be a good idea to extract part of the archive template to a separate /template-parts folder.
I have in mind single book "card", it's design and layout may won't be used only on archive page, but could 
be also fe. on Home page. 
Such solution would remove code duplications.
